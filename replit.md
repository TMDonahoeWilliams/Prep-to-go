## Recent Changes

- **2025-10-22**: Deployment optimizations
  - Added health check endpoint at `/` for deployment health checks
  - Moved category seeding to development mode only (not production)
  - Server starts immediately and stays alive for production deployments
  - All integration requirements complete with consistent error handling

- **2025-01-22**: Initial MVP implementation
  - Complete frontend with all pages and components
  - Database schema and backend API design
  - Replit Auth integration
  - Dark mode support
  - Responsive design across all breakpoints

## Deployment

### Production Configuration
- Health check endpoint: `GET /api/health` returns `{ status: 'ok', service: 'College Prep Organizer' }`
- Frontend served at: `GET /` returns the React application HTML
- Category seeding: Only runs in development mode to prevent startup delays
- Server listens on port 5000 (configurable via PORT env variable)
- Database categories must be seeded manually in production on first deployment

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (auto-configured)
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key (auto-configured)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to 'production' for deployment
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 5000)

## Development Notes

### Design System
- Primary color: Purple (262Â° 83% 58%)
- Success: Green for completed tasks
- Warning: Orange for upcoming deadlines
- Destructive: Red for overdue items
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- Design philosophy: Linear-inspired productivity with Notion-like organization

### Key Design Decisions
- Sidebar navigation on desktop, bottom nav on mobile
- Card-based layouts for better visual organization
- Subtle hover states and transitions
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Accessible color contrast ratios
- Empty states with clear CTAs

### Testing Considerations
- All interactive elements have data-testid attributes
- Auth flow requires Replit Auth setup
- Database operations use PostgreSQL transactions
- Session management with secure cookies
