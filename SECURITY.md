# 🔒 IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

## ⚠️ BEFORE PUSHING TO GITHUB

**CRITICAL: Your `.env` file contains LIVE Stripe keys and sensitive data!**

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. **NEVER commit your `.env` file to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Make sure .env is in your .gitignore
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Remove any hardcoded secrets from your code**
   - Check all files for exposed API keys
   - Ensure all sensitive data uses environment variables

3. **Regenerate Stripe keys if already exposed**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard
   - Generate new secret keys
   - Update your environment variables

### BEFORE GOING LIVE:

- [ ] Switch to Stripe LIVE keys (not test keys)
- [ ] Set up Stripe webhooks for your production domain
- [ ] Use strong, unique `SESSION_SECRET`
- [ ] Enable production security settings
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error logging
- [ ] Test payment flow thoroughly
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins

### CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ `.env.example` created for reference
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured to exclude sensitive files
- ✅ Environment-based configuration ready
- ✅ Security middleware implemented
- ✅ Production build scripts ready

### NEXT STEPS:
1. Initialize git repository (if not already done)
2. Commit all files EXCEPT `.env`
3. Push to GitHub
4. Set up deployment on your chosen platform
5. Configure production environment variables
6. Deploy and test thoroughly

**Remember: NEVER commit secrets to version control!**
